# HalfSovle : Solving Linear systems with SSE2 in mixed and half precision for devices that dont natively support it.
## It is not the fastest solver and certainly not the most numerically stable solver but it is definitely one of the solvers of all time.
## May or may not extend it to use AVX2 and AVX512 or more operations if i ever feel like playing with it more.
## Requires SSE3 and FMA to run
